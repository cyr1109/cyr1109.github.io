        <p>I study what influences and motivates choices
          in information markets. I am especially interested in data markets
          where individuals supply personal data to firms.
          I am also interested in the interaction of rights assignments and
          information-sharing behavior. My research method primarily uses randomized,
          controlled experiments to elicit decisions over real outcomes.</p>

                  Internet users regularly choose to generate and share personal data in return for goods and services.
                  Data has amassed to a point where firms are looking to externally exploit personal data assets.
                  Average consumers are excluded from this secondary market.<br></br>
                  An online experiment with 1,188 participants was conducted
                  to elicit individuals' willingness-to-share their personally-identifiable, user-generated, psychometric data with others.
                  I predicted and found that
                  <em>individuals behaved more privately in response to greater awareness of a data recipient's secondary market exploitation abilities</em>
                  (or demanded greater benefits in exchange for privacy-losses).
                  I also found that privacy-seeking behavior was less responsive to increased exposure (to more data recipients)
                  than information provisions about secondary data markets.<br></br>

                      Licensing agreements are popular for transacting ideas without exchanging intellectual property ownership,
                      and their royalty amounts are often negotiated between the licensors and licensees.
                      These decisions may be subject to biases and heuristics since the valuation of ideas
                      is inherently difficult and intellectual property rights are abstract.<br></br>

                      Using three experimental studies (N = {167, 272, 283}),
                      I measured individualsâ€™ royalty amounts they were willing-to-accept (or pay) to license potential solutions to a logic problem.
                      I predicted and found <em>disparities in acceptable royalty amounts between licensors and licensees of ideas,
                      even in the absence of information asymmetries</em> (i.e., between non-creator owners and non-owners).
                      I also found that valuation gaps for higher quality ideas were tempered by providing
                      licensors and licensees with third-party expert assessments of an idea's potential to succeed; however,
                      licensors persisted in inflating their royalty amounts (relative to licensees) for low quality ideas.
